Manual on how to play:

Objective:
The goal of the Crazy 8 card game is to be the first player to empty their hand by playing cards that match the top card of the discard pile in either rank or suit.
Setup:
1.	Deck Creation:
•	The game uses a standard 52-card deck.
•	Each card has a rank (2-10, J, Q, K, A) and a suit (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades).
2.	Dealing:
•	Players are dealt an initial hand of 8 cards.
•	The last card of the deck is the initial card to play on top of, acting as the starting card for the discard pile.
3.	Special Cards:
•	The game includes special cards, such as 8s, 2s and Js of any suit.
•	8s are wild cards which allow the player who plays them to change the suit.
•	2s are wild cards which allow the player to force their opponent in drawing 2 cards from the draw pile.
•	Js are wild cards which allow the player to skip their opponent’s turn by 1 or for them to gain an extra turn on their move.

Gameplay:
1.	The game starts with a welcoming message and briefly explains the rules of the game as well as the ability which each special card possesses.
2.	The user is prompted to enter the name of players 1 and 2.
3.	Afterwards a message is displayed which prompts the user to enter any key to start except for the period key. 
4.	As soon as the key is entered, the current card acting as the very base of the discard pile is displayed and player’s one’s hand of eight random cards is displayed.
5.	The user is prompted to enter the number of the card they would like to play from the cards displayed on the screen.
6.	The players will suffer penalties for any incorrect cards played on the discard pile such as drawing an extra card.
7.	In order to draw first instead of play a card, the zero number should be used.
8.	The game will then generate the same grouping of messages and prompts for player two until each player eventually runs out of cards and a winner is found.
9.	Once the game has been completed, it will display a prompt, asking whether players wish to play the game again.
